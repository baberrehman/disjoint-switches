# Artifact: Union Types with Disjoint Switches

Title of the submitted paper: Union Types with Disjoint Switches

ECOOP submission number for the paper: 69

## Overview: What does the artifact comprise?

This artifact contains the mechanical formalization of the calculi 
associated with the paper Union Types with Disjoint Switches.
All the metatheory has been formalized in Coq theorem prover.
We provide a docker image as well the code archive.

We claim the functional, reusable, and available badges.

## For authors claiming a functional or reusable badge: What are claims about the artifact’s functionality to be evaluated by the committee?

All the the metatheory and theorems stated in paper can be found in the artifact.

**Note:** Please follow the steps under *Getting Started* to 
access the artifact and look into the directory hierarchy.

### Code Structure:

There are 4 sub-folders in the artifact in *code* folder:
1) section3
2) section4
3) section51
4) section52

Each folder contains Coq formalization for a variant of our calculus discussed in paper.

## For authors claiming a reusable badge: What are the authors' claims about the artifact's reusability to be evaluated by the committee?

More features can be added in the metatheory. For example, merge operator
and disjoint intersection types. This is also discussed in Section 6
in the paper.

## For authors claiming an available badge

We agree to publish under a Creative Commons license on DARTS.

## Artifact Requirements

We tested all the Coq files using Coq version 8.13.1. Please use same version for the sake
of consistency.

Coq TLC and Coq Metatheory libraries are also required to run the artifact.


## Getting Started

We provide two alternatives to run the artifact:
1) Docker Image
2) Build From Scratch

# 1) Docker Image #

This is the easiest way to run the artifact.
We provide a docker image with all the dependencies installed in it.

This section explains how to pull the docker image of artifact from docker repo and use it.
Run the following commands one by one in terminal:

1. `$ docker pull anoms/switches`
2. `$ docker run -it anoms/switches`


**Note:** Please note that **$** symbol appearing in
the beginning is not a part of the command.


The artifact is located in the directory: */home/coq/code*

`$ cd /home/coq/code`

There are 4 folders in the artifact, with make file in each.

1. **section3** → Discussed in section 3 in paper
2. **section4** → Discussed in section 4 in paper
3. **section51** → Discussed in section 5.1 in paper
4. **section52** → Discussed in section 5.2 in paper

Go to each folder and run make:

### section3

1. `$ cd /home/coq/code/section3`
2. `$ make`

### section4

1. `$ cd /home/coq/code/section4`
2. `$ make`


Note that compilation of equivalence.v takes a few minutes
to complete.


### section51

1. `$ cd /home/coq/code/section51`
2. `$ make`

### section52

1. `$ cd /home/coq/code/section52`
2. `$ make`

Please feel free to go through the code in each section.
**vim** and **cat** commands are available to look into the files.
Recommended way to look into the files is by downloading the 
code archive from the given git repo.

This completes the evaluation of artifact following docker image.


# 2) Build from Scratch #

This section explains how to build the artifact from scratch.

### Prerequisites
We tested all the Coq files using Coq version 8.13.1. Please use same version for the sake
of consistency. We recommend installing Coq using the opam package installer.

`$ opam install coq.8.13.1`

Refer to this link for more information and installation
steps: https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html

### Required Libraries

Coq TLC and Coq Metatheory libraries are required to compile the code.
Next, we explain briefly how to install each.

TLC library can also be installed using the opam package installer.

Run the following commands one by one to install TLC by opam package installer:

1. `$ opam repo add coq-released http://coq.inria.fr/opam/released`
2. `$ opam install coq-tlc.20210316`

Please refer to this link for detailed compilation and installation of Coq TLC:
https://github.com/charguer/tlc/tree/20210316

Metatheory can be installed by following the instructions at this link:
https://github.com/plclub/metalib


### Getting the files
Use the following commands to clone our git repo.
Please note that **$** symbol is not a part of command:

`$ git clone https://github.com/anomsresearch/disjoint-switches.git`

You should be able to see all the Coq files inside folder *code*
after cloning the repo. Alternatively you can download the zip file
from repo and you should be able to see all the Coq files after unzipping it.

There are 4 sub-folders in the *code* folder, with make file in each.

1. **section3** → Discussed in section 3 in paper
2. **section4** → Discussed in section 4 in paper
3. **section51** → Discussed in section 5.1 in paper
4. **section52** → Discussed in section 5.2 in paper

**Note:** Please make sure to run `$ eval $(opam env)` if Coq
is installed using opam. This command can be skipped otherwise.

Open the terminal in each each folder and run make:

### section3

1. `$ eval $(opam env)` (optional)
2. `$ make`

Similarly, section4, section51 and section52 can be compiled
by opening the terminal in each respective folder and
running the `make` command.

Please feel free to go through the code in each section.
This completes the evaluation of artifact following build from scratch.
